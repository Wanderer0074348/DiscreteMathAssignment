## Assignment Question Explaination
**File:** `main.py`

This Python code defines a function `nonnegative_integer_solutions(k, n)` that generates all combinations of k nonnegative integers that sum up to n.

**Imports:**

```python
import itertools
```

This line imports the `itertools` module, which provides functions for generating sequences and combinations.

**Function Definition:**

```python
def nonnegative_integer_solutions(k, n):
    # Generate all combinations of k nonnegative integers that sum up to n
    combinations = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(n+1), k)

    # Filter out the combinations that sum up to n
    solutions = [comb for comb in combinations if sum(comb) == n]

    return solutions
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Line 1**: This line defines the function `nonnegative_integer_solutions` with two parameters, `k` and `n`. `k` represents the number of non-negative integers, and `n` represents the target sum.
2. **Line 3**: This line uses `itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(n+1), k)` to generate all possible combinations of k non-negative integers (including 0) that sum up to at most n.
3. **Line 5**: This line uses a list comprehension to filter out the combinations that do not sum up to n. The `sum(comb)` function calculates the sum of each combination, and the `== n` condition checks if the sum is equal to the target sum.
4. **Line 6**: This line returns the list of valid combinations that sum up to n.

**Example Usage:**

```python
k = 5
n = 5
solutions = nonnegative_integer_solutions(k, n)

# Printing them in format x1+x2+xk=n
for sol in solutions:
    print(' + '.join([str(x) for x in sol]) + ' = ' + str(n))
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `nonnegative_integer_solutions` function. It sets k to 5 and n to 5, then calls the function to generate the solutions. Finally, it iterates through the solutions and prints them in the format x1+x2+...+xk=n.

**Output:**

```
1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 5
0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 5
0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5
```

This code is useful for solving problems that involve finding combinations of non-negative integers that sum up to a specific value.
